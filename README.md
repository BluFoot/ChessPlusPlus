## Description
ChessPlusPlus is a modular game of chess programmed with the latest gadgets and gizmos in C++, namely whatever happens to be the most recently released standard (currently C++11, soon to be C++14). The project aims to show the simplicity and elegance of C++ and to constantly use the latest features of the language and the most modern design practices.

Thus, the travis-ci build status will almost always be failing, since travis-ci's C++ compilers are generally behind the times. Ineed, you yourself will need the latest and greatest in C++ compliation technology if you wish to compile ChessPlusPlus for yourself.

But fear not, for you are not the only one seeking the latest and greatest - for example the [nuwen MinGW distro](http://nuwen.net/mingw.html) is generally up to par with the most modern stuff, and if you're not on Windows you can always just use your friendly neighborhood gcc. LLVM's clang is a superhero too, you know, and libc++ rivals gcc's libstdc++.
